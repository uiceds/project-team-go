## Discussion

Based on the previous findings, the project demonstrated predictive modeling of biomass production using decision tree regression and SVD for dimensionality reduction. 
While the decision tree model showed higher accuracy (up to 97.14%), its performance may face challenges with larger datasets.
Additionally, the neural network model faced limitations, with poorer fit and higher RMSE. 
Future work should focus on refining model structures to improve accuracy and consistency across different datasets by steps such as expanding datasets, applying different machine learning methods, and solving existing neural network challenges.
