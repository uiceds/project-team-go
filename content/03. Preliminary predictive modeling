# Data Description

## Explanation of Columns

The dataset includes several key columns, each playing an essential role in the analysis. 
The _sim_index_ column represents the simulation timeline, allowing the data to be tracked sequentially. 
While not directly used in the model, it helps visualize time-dependent trends. 
The _MULTIPLIER_FOR_RAINFALL_ column is a scaling factor applied to raw rainfall data, reflecting environmental adjustments or experimental conditions. 
Using this multiplier, the rain_amount column is calculated as the cumulative rainfall over time, 
serving as the independent variable in the regression analysis to explore its impact on biomass production.
The _precipitation_ column indicates the level of rainfall at each time point, providing additional environmental context. 
Similarly, the _soil_moisture_ column captures the moisture levels in the soil, influenced by rainfall and precipitation. 
This column is not directly used in the predictive model now.
Finally, the _total_biomass_ column represents the dependent variable, measuring the biomass produced under given conditions. 
This serves as the target variable in the regression model, with predictions based on the _rain_amount_ variable. 
Together, these columns create a comprehensive dataset for analyzing the interplay between rainfall and biomass in varying environmental conditions.

## Relationships and Usage in Code

The datasetâ€™s variables are used in specific ways to build and analyze the predictive model. 
The _rain_amount column_, derived by multiplying _MULTIPLIER_FOR_RAINFALL_ and _raw rainfall_ data, 
serves as the core predictor to model its relationship with total_biomass.
This dependent variable acts as the target for the regression analysis, allowing the model to evaluate its predictive accuracy. 
Supporting variables such as _precipitation_ and _soil_moisture_ provide additional environmental context, 
which could be leveraged for feature engineering in more advanced models. 
The _sim_index_ ensures that the data can be tracked sequentially for exploratory analysis and visualization. 
These relationships enable the construction of a decision tree regression model, which uses _rain_amount_ to predict _total_biomass_, 
and its performance is validated through visualizations and comparisons with the observed data.

# _1 Model Construction and Analysis_

##  _1.1 Decision Tree Regression_

For this project, we implemented a custom decision tree regression model. Below is the detailed logic of the model:
Model Principle:
The decision tree recursively partitions the data, dividing the feature space into smaller subregions. Each subregion is represented by the mean value of the target variable.
The tree-building process involves:
Optimal Split Selection: Iterating through all possible split points (unique rainfall values) to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Recursive Subtree Construction: Splitting data into left and right branches and continuing until the predefined maximum depth or a minimum number of samples is reached.
Termination Criteria: If the sample size in a node is less than min_samples_split or the tree reaches the maximum depth, the node returns the mean value of the target variable.
