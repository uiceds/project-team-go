# Data Description

## Explanation of Columns

The dataset includes several key columns, each playing an essential role in the analysis. 
The sim_index column represents the simulation timeline, allowing the data to be tracked sequentially. 
While not directly used in the model, it helps visualize time-dependent trends. 
The MULTIPLIER_FOR_RAINFALL column is a scaling factor applied to raw rainfall data, reflecting environmental adjustments or experimental conditions. 
Using this multiplier, the rain_amount column is calculated as the cumulative rainfall over time, 
serving as the independent variable in the regression analysis to explore its impact on biomass production.
The precipitation column indicates the level of rainfall at each time point, providing additional environmental context. 
Similarly, the soil_moisture column captures the moisture levels in the soil, influenced by rainfall and precipitation. 
Although not directly used in the predictive model, these variables add depth and context to the dataset, 
enabling potential feature engineering for more complex analyses. 
Finally, the total_biomass column represents the dependent variable, measuring the biomass produced under given conditions. 
This serves as the target variable in the regression model, with predictions based on the rain_amount variable. 
Together, these columns create a comprehensive dataset for analyzing the interplay between rainfall and biomass in varying environmental conditions.

## Relationships and Usage in Code

The datasetâ€™s variables are used in specific ways to build and analyze the predictive model. 
The rain_amount column, derived by multiplying MULTIPLIER_FOR_RAINFALL and raw rainfall data, 
serves as the core predictor to model its relationship with total_biomass.
This dependent variable acts as the target for the regression analysis, allowing the model to evaluate its predictive accuracy. 
Supporting variables such as precipitation and soil_moisture provide additional environmental context, 
which could be leveraged for feature engineering in more advanced models. 
The sim_index ensures that the data can be tracked sequentially for exploratory analysis and visualization. 
These relationships enable the construction of a decision tree regression model, which uses rain_amount to predict total_biomass, 
and its performance is validated through visualizations and comparisons with the observed data.

# _1 Model Construction and Analysis_

##  _1.1 Decision Tree Regression_

For this project, we implemented a custom decision tree regression model. Below is the detailed logic of the model:
Model Principle:
The decision tree recursively partitions the data, dividing the feature space into smaller subregions. Each subregion is represented by the mean value of the target variable.
The tree-building process involves:
Optimal Split Selection: Iterating through all possible split points (unique rainfall values) to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Recursive Subtree Construction: Splitting data into left and right branches and continuing until the predefined maximum depth or a minimum number of samples is reached.
Termination Criteria: If the sample size in a node is less than min_samples_split or the tree reaches the maximum depth, the node returns the mean value of the target variable.
