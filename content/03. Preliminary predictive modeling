##  _1.1 Decision Tree Regression_

For this project, we implemented a custom decision tree regression model. Below is the detailed logic of the model:
Model Principle:
The decision tree recursively partitions the data, dividing the feature space into smaller subregions. Each subregion is represented by the mean value of the target variable.
The tree-building process involves:
Optimal Split Selection: Iterating through all possible split points (unique rainfall values) to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Recursive Subtree Construction: Splitting data into left and right branches and continuing until the predefined maximum depth or a minimum number of samples is reached.
Termination Criteria: If the sample size in a node is less than min_samples_split or the tree reaches the maximum depth, the node returns the mean value of the target variable.
