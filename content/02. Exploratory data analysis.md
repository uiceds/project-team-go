## Exploratory data analysis {.page_break_before}

__1. Background and Research Proposal__

Crop models are computational tools that assess the effects of environmental variation and cultivation strategies on crop yield (Chapagain et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2019). By incorporating factors such as precipitation, humidity, temperature, fertilization, and soil properties, crop models establish relationships between input parameters and agricultural yield outcomes. From a structural perspective, crop models can be either empirical or mechanistic. Empirical models create statistical relationships based on existing data, while mechanistic models aim to explain relationships by exploring physiological mechanisms and causal connections (Reynolds and Acock, 1985). From a parameter standpoint, crop models generally include weather, soil, and crop-specific parameters to estimate crop yield. Weather parameters cover solar radiation, precipitation, temperature, and more, while soil parameters focus on humus content, organic matter content, and other soil characteristics. Crop-specific parameters include maximum crop yield, specific nitrogen uptake rate, and related factors.

In this project, we aim to replicate Hartmut Bossel's 'Field Crop Cultivation' simulation model as a white-box reference and develop a black-box model using SVD, PCA, and/or Fourier series. The original model is a parsimonious one, primarily focused on the dynamic effects of precipitation on crop yield across a spectrum of crops in Germany. Initially created in BASIC (Hartmut, 1985) and later in Vensim (Hartmut, 2007) for educational purposes, the model simulates the impact of water and nutrient (nitrogen) availability on plant growth dynamics. Built from first principles, it captures complex interactions between water and nutrient dynamics and can be adapted to different scenarios by applying specific plant and soil parameters.

__2. Reference model Construction__

In our project, we have already translated the model into Python as the reference model. We modularized the code into three phases to enhance customization and improve understanding:
The first part of the code focuses on preparing input values, which involve defining constants and table functions that are used in the next stage. The second part integrates two sub-models: soil-water and soil-nutrient. The ‘Soilwater’ model determines the soil water content based on two key factors: water-related parameters and soil parameters. The water-related parameters describe the mass balance of water (precipitation, irrigation, transpiration, evaporation, and percolation). In parallel, the soil parameters define the water-holding capacity of the soil. The other sub-model ‘Soilnutrient’ contains a mass balance for nitrogen (the interconnection between plant available nitrogen and humus in soil). In summary, soil-water and soil-nutrient are fundamentally important to estimate the yield. In the third part, the output data is presented as diagrams (or in csv files), visualizing the simulation results and enabling analysis of how changing factors influence crop yield.

__3.1 Selecting Climate Zone and Sampling Points__

In this study, three typical U.S. crops, corn, cotton, and wheat, were selected as examples in our analysis. These crops are grown in different climate zones and play a vital role in U.S. agriculture. The figures above (Figure1, 2, 3) show an overlay analysis of the major production areas of corn, wheat, and cotton in the US, along with different climate zones. Meteorological data from typical cities within these climate zones were gathered and sepcified. The range of temperature and precipitation in the past 20 years were needed to examine these overlays.

We can clearly see the locations where each crop's high-yield regions intersect with various climate zones, enabling us to understand how climate factors influence each crop's growth conditions. For instance, Fig 3.1.1 suggests that the majority of corn production area in the US lies in humid continental warm/cool summer climate zones, and from Fig 3.1.3 one can see that cotton production areas are mainly in humid subtropical and semiarid steppe climate, indicating the differences in heat and precipitation requirements between cotton and corn.

To scientifically analyze the impact of climate on crop yields, the study first chose climate data sampling points based on the United States crop production maps (USDA United States - Crop Production Maps), which recorded the key production areas for different crops. Climate data, including monthly average temperature and monthly precipitation, were collected from three different weather monitoring stations within each key production area. Climate data from 2004 to 2024, within a 20-year period of time, was collected and used in this study for model analysis.

Here, the climatic characteristics of a region was demonstrated by monthly average temperature and monthly average precipitation within a 20-year peroid of time. For example, the State of Illinois, of which mostly is humid continental climate, is a major corn production area in the US. The characteristics of this climate type is presented by temperature and precipitation data from Champaign. Similarly, meteorological data of Nobel County in Minnesota, as a typical wheat production area located in humid continential cool-summer climate zone, was also demonstrated. Port Mansfield in Texas was picked to represent the climate characteristics of a typical cotton-growing area.

*Figure7. Model Results Under Varying Precipitation in Humid Subtropical Climate (Stoneville, MS)*

Figure 7. shows the mechanistic model results for soil water and nutrient dynamics in a humid subtropical climate (Stoneville, Mississippi) under varying precipitation scenarios (maximum, mean, and minimum). The results are shown in two sets of plots. The x-axis represents time within one year, ranging from 0 to 1. Plots in the first row (a, b, c) display the changes in soil nutrients over time, specifically total biomass (red), nitrogen available to plants (green), and organic matter fraction in soil (blue). Plots in the second row (d, e, f) illustrate the in precipitation with randomized weather event (blue line), groundwater levels (red line), and soil water content (blue line) across three precipitation scenarios.

From the soil nutrient data, we can observe the seasonal dynamics of biomass levels as well as plant-available nitrogen in the soil. At the beginning of cultivation, with the application of fertilizer, nitrogen levels reach their peak and then decrease as the crop continues to grow. From the soil water data, we can see that a water surplus exists in both the max and mean rainfall scenarios, leading to a significant rise in groundwater levels (d, e).

__4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis on Reference Model Results, Humid Continental (warm summer)__

*Figure 8. Model Results Under Varying Precipitation in Humid Continental (warm summer) (Arnold, IA)*

Figure 8. shows the mechanistic model results for soil water and nutrient dynamics in a humid subtropical climate (Arnold, Iowa) under varying precipitation scenarios (maximum, mean, and minimum). In soil water, we can see three precipitation cases covers high water excess, minor water deficit and large water deficit, indication that the locational conditions can be a good setting for us to use this reference model to explain the situation. Also, notice that the precipitation pattern (blue) is different from Stoneville, and hence causing different dynamics in soil water content (green), for example, no significant seasonal variation.
