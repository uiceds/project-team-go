## Preliminary Predictive Modeling

This section focuses on predictive modeling and dimensionality reduction for analyzing the relationship between rainfall and corn yield under varying environmental scenarios. The study leverages a mechanistic dataset with high dimensionality and computational complexity. The primary objectives include implementing a decision tree regression model for single-scenario prediction and utilizing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for multi-scenario dimensionality reduction. By combining these approaches, the project aims to reduce computational cost while preserving the predictive accuracy and interpretability of the model.

*Figure 1. Output data of one scenario*

The dataset includes 100 rows of data and several key columns, each playing an essential role in the analysis. 
The _sim_index_ column represents the simulation timeline, allowing the data to be tracked sequentially. 
While not directly used in the model, it helps visualize time-dependent trends. 
The _MULTIPLIER_FOR_RAINFALL_ column is a scaling factor applied to raw rainfall data, reflecting environmental adjustments or experimental conditions. 
Using this multiplier, the rain_amount column is calculated as the cumulative rainfall over time, 
serving as the independent variable in the regression analysis to explore its impact on biomass production.
The _precipitation_ column indicates the level of rainfall at each time point, providing additional environmental context. 
Similarly, the _soil_moisture_ column captures the moisture levels in the soil, influenced by rainfall and precipitation. 
This column is not directly used in the predictive model now.
Finally, the _total_biomass_ column represents the dependent variable, measuring the biomass produced under given conditions. 
This serves as the target variable in the regression model, with predictions based on the _rain_amount_ variable. 
Together, these columns create a comprehensive dataset for analyzing the interplay between rainfall and biomass in varying environmental conditions.

### 1.2 Relationships and Usage in Code

The dataset’s variables are used in specific ways to build and analyze the predictive model. 
The _rain_amount column_, derived by multiplying _MULTIPLIER_FOR_RAINFALL_ and _raw rainfall_ data, 
serves as the core predictor to model its relationship with total_biomass.
This dependent variable acts as the target for the regression analysis, allowing the model to evaluate its predictive accuracy. 
Supporting variables such as _precipitation_ and _soil_moisture_ provide additional environmental context, 
which could be leveraged for feature engineering in more advanced models. 
The _sim_index_ ensures that the data can be tracked sequentially for exploratory analysis and visualization. 
These relationships enable the construction of a decision tree regression model, which uses _rain_amount_ to predict _total_biomass_, 
and its performance is validated through visualizations and comparisons with the observed data.

## 2 Model Function Description

The core of this project is to implement a simple decision tree regression model from scratch without relying on external machine learning libraries. The basic idea of decision tree regression is to recursively split the dataset into homogeneous subsets and estimate the mean of each subset to predict the target variable. Specifically, the model consists of the following modules:

### 2.1 Decision Tree Construction Function

The goal of this function is to construct a regression tree model based on the feature data (P) and target data (B).

**Stopping Criteria:** The recursion stops when the sample size is less than or equal to the minimum split sample size (min_samples_split), or when the maximum depth (depth) is reached. In this case, the mean of the target variable is used as the prediction value.

**Finding the Best Split Point:** The model attempts to iterate over all unique values of the feature to find the split point that minimizes the error (sum of squared losses) for the left and right subsets. The smaller the squared loss, the higher the homogeneity of the dataset.

**Recursive Splitting:** Once the best split point is found, the model splits the data into left and right subtrees and recursively constructs the subtrees until the stopping criteria are met.

### 2.2 Model Workflow

**Training Phase:** The decision_tree_regression function is used to recursively split the training dataset and construct the decision tree model. At each step of the split, the possible split points are iterated over, and the squared loss is calculated to select the optimal split point, dividing the dataset into two homogeneous subsets.

**Prediction Phase:** The predict_tree function is used to predict new data. Each new feature value is directed through the tree's split rules to find the corresponding leaf node, and the mean value of that node is output as the final prediction.

### 2.3 Experimental Results and Analysis

By testing the decision tree regression model on the rainfall data and the biomass data, it was observed that the model effectively performed segmented predictions based on the given data, which continuously split the feature space to minimize the variance of the target variable as much as possible. The goodness of fit is used to estimate the prediction outcome, which is calculated as follows:


$R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{SS} _{\text{tot}}}{\text{SS} _{\text{res}}}$, 
in which ${\text{SS} _{\text{tot}}}$ is Total Sum of Squares, ${\text{SS} _{\text{res}}}$ is Residual Sum of Squares.

Although this implementation is relatively simplified, it effectively demonstrates the core ideas and basic construction process of decision tree regression.

*Figure 3. Prediction result of model with depth 3*

Figure 3 is the result of model with depth 3 which has a goodness of fit 96.91%. It can be observed that as the number of layers in the decision tree increases, its fitting performance in the early stages improves. In fact, the final goodness of fit is also higher.

## Multiple Scenario Analysis by Using SVD and PCA

## 3 Data Description for All Scenario

We aim to recreate a simplified surrogate model to reduce the computation time of the mechanistic model. In the mechanistic model, 17 different variables are calculated for every iteration. Each variable represents time-series data consisting of 100 data points over a 1-year range. Among these variables, 'precipitation' and 'multiplier for precipitation' serve as inputs, and their combination constitutes a new scenario. 'Total biomass' refers to the yield of corn, which is the final output. The remaining 14 variables are intermediate variables used in the calculations. In summary, for every scenario, the outputs include 17 time-series variables, each with 100 data points, accumulating to a total of 1,700 data points per scenario.

To generate a spectrum of scenarios for better estimation of corn yield across the U.S., we overlap the major corn production map with the climate zone map and select 9 sampling locations representing three major climate zones. For each location, precipitation data is gathered over a 20- to 21-year period. Additional scenarios are generated by using corrected precipitation, calculated as the product of meteorological 'precipitation' data and a 'multiplier for precipitation' ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 (representing suboptimal conditions). This approach results in a total of 1,692 scenarios, which is the product of the number of locations (9), years of precipitation data (20-21), and multipliers for precipitation (9). It is also confirmed that the simulation data remains consistent and can be accurately reconstructed after this data transformation process.

In summary, the dataset consists of 1692 scenarios and 1700 datapoints for each scenario. Using the mechanistic model to generate this dataset and stored as a csv file, consisting inputs, output and intermediate variables.

## 4 Dimension Reduction by SVD

The original mechanistic model consists of 87 equations and above 100 variables for each iteration step, 15 of which are integral equations updated at each iteration. This high dimensionality and computational complexity increase computational time and make the model difficult to interpret. To address these challenges, we apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, evaluate the contribution of the most important principal components, and recreate the dataset using the compressed eigenvectors.

To prepare the dataset for SVD, we first reorganized the data by stretching all the data points in one scenario into a single column in the DataFrame. Each variable has 100 time-series elements and the number of columns equals the total number of scenarios. Second, we calculated the average scenario by horizontally taking the mean value across scenarios, then subtracted this average scenario from the dataset itself to obtain the centered data (X). Third, we performed SVD on the centered data to obtain the three singular components (U, S, and V'). 

Figure 4 illustrates the singular values (𝐹.𝑆) plotted on a logarithmic scale, highlighting that the dataset's variance starts relatively small and decreases sharply at the initial stage. It can be estimated from the model that the variance explained by the first three principal components (PCA modes) captures more than 99.5% of the variance, indicating that it is sufficient to reconstruct the dataset using the first three PCA modes. Additionally, Table 1 visualizes the first 10 eigen-scenarios (columns of 𝐹.𝑈), providing insights into the dataset's principal structures. Finally, the dataset was reconstructed using the compressed data from the SVD process, and Table 2 displays the scenario reconstructed as the number of the PCA modes increase.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of decision tree regression for predictive modeling in one scenario and SVD for dimensionality reduction. In the single scenario analysis, the decision tree regression effectively predicts biomass based on rainfall data, with high goodness-of-fit scores for both shallow and deep trees. In the multi-scenario analysis, the SVD process reduces the dataset's dimensionality while retaining critical information, enabling more efficient modeling and interpretation.
These methods provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing complex datasets in agricultural and environmental studies. Future work could explore integrating additional features, such as soil properties, or applying more advanced machine learning models to further improve predictive performance.
