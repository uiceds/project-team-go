## Abstract

__Project proposal__

The crop model ia a computational tool that assess the effects of environmental variation and cultivation strategies on crop yield. In this project, we are interested in establishing a crop model to predict corn yield based on environmental variations including precipitation and temperature Meteorological data set used in model analysis and prediction covered data of major crop production areas with different climate types. Data was obtained from wunderground.com, an online database, and crop yield data used for training and testing data was generated by Hartmut Bossel's 'Field Crop Cultivation' simulation model. As exploratory data analysis, a black-box model using SVD, PCA, and/or Fourier series was be then developed. A convolutional neuro network model was finally established to realize prediction of crop yield based on annual precipitation.
