<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The crop model ia a computational tool that assess the effects of environmental variation and cultivation strategies on crop yield. In this project, we are interested in establishing a crop model to predict corn yield based on environmental variations including precipitation and temperature Meteorological data set used in model analysis and prediction covered data of major crop production areas with different climate types. Data was obtained from wunderground.com, an online database, and crop yield data used for training and testing data was generated by Hartmut Bossel’s ‘Field Crop Cultivation’ simulation model. As exploratory data analysis, a black-box model using SVD, PCA, and/or Fourier series was be then developed. A convolutional neuro network model was finally established to realize prediction of crop yield based on annual precipitation.</p>
<h2 class="page_break_before" id="exploratory-data-analysis">Exploratory data analysis</h2>
<p><strong>1. Background and Research Proposal</strong></p>
<p>Crop models are computational tools that assess the effects of environmental variation and cultivation strategies on crop yield (Chapagain et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2019). By incorporating factors such as precipitation, humidity, temperature, fertilization, and soil properties, crop models establish relationships between input parameters and agricultural yield outcomes. From a structural perspective, crop models can be either empirical or mechanistic. Empirical models create statistical relationships based on existing data, while mechanistic models aim to explain relationships by exploring physiological mechanisms and causal connections (Reynolds and Acock, 1985). From a parameter standpoint, crop models generally include weather, soil, and crop-specific parameters to estimate crop yield. Weather parameters cover solar radiation, precipitation, temperature, and more, while soil parameters focus on humus content, organic matter content, and other soil characteristics. Crop-specific parameters include maximum crop yield, specific nitrogen uptake rate, and related factors.</p>
<p>In this project, we aim to replicate Hartmut Bossel’s ‘Field Crop Cultivation’ simulation model as a white-box reference and develop a black-box model using SVD, PCA, and/or Fourier series. The original model is a parsimonious one, primarily focused on the dynamic effects of precipitation on crop yield across a spectrum of crops in Germany. Initially created in BASIC (Hartmut, 1985) and later in Vensim (Hartmut, 2007) for educational purposes, the model simulates the impact of water and nutrient (nitrogen) availability on plant growth dynamics. Built from first principles, it captures complex interactions between water and nutrient dynamics and can be adapted to different scenarios by applying specific plant and soil parameters.</p>
<p><strong>2. Reference model Construction</strong></p>
<p>In our project, we have already translated the model into Python as the reference model. We modularized the code into three phases to enhance customization and improve understanding:
The first part of the code focuses on preparing input values, which involve defining constants and table functions that are used in the next stage. The second part integrates two sub-models: soil-water and soil-nutrient. The ‘Soilwater’ model determines the soil water content based on two key factors: water-related parameters and soil parameters. The water-related parameters describe the mass balance of water (precipitation, irrigation, transpiration, evaporation, and percolation). In parallel, the soil parameters define the water-holding capacity of the soil. The other sub-model ‘Soilnutrient’ contains a mass balance for nitrogen (the interconnection between plant available nitrogen and humus in soil). In summary, soil-water and soil-nutrient are fundamentally important to estimate the yield. In the third part, the output data is presented as diagrams (or in csv files), visualizing the simulation results and enabling analysis of how changing factors influence crop yield.</p>
<p><strong>3. Data Preparation</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1 Selecting Climate Zone and Sampling Points</strong></p>

<p><em>Figure 3 Cotton Production Distribution by County in the United States </em></p>
<p>In this study, three typical U.S. crops, corn, cotton, and wheat, were selected as examples in our analysis. These crops are grown in different climate zones and play a vital role in U.S. agriculture. The figures above (Figure1, 2, 3) show an overlay analysis of the major production areas of corn, wheat, and cotton in the US, along with different climate zones. Meteorological data from typical cities within these climate zones were gathered and sepcified. The range of temperature and precipitation in the past 20 years were needed to examine these overlays.</p>
<p>We can clearly see the locations where each crop’s high-yield regions intersect with various climate zones, enabling us to understand how climate factors influence each crop’s growth conditions. For instance, Fig 3.1.1 suggests that the majority of corn production area in the US lies in humid continental warm/cool summer climate zones, and from Fig 3.1.3 one can see that cotton production areas are mainly in humid subtropical and semiarid steppe climate, indicating the differences in heat and precipitation requirements between cotton and corn.</p>

<p>To scientifically analyze the impact of climate on crop yields, the study first chose climate data sampling points based on the United States crop production maps (USDA United States - Crop Production Maps), which recorded the key production areas for different crops. Climate data, including monthly average temperature and monthly precipitation, were collected from three different weather monitoring stations within each key production area. Climate data from 2004 to 2024, within a 20-year period of time, was collected and used in this study for model analysis.</p>
<p>Here, the climatic characteristics of a region was demonstrated by monthly average temperature and monthly average precipitation within a 20-year peroid of time. For example, the State of Illinois, of which mostly is humid continental climate, is a major corn production area in the US. The characteristics of this climate type is presented by temperature and precipitation data from Champaign. Similarly, meteorological data of Nobel County in Minnesota, as a typical wheat production area located in humid continential cool-summer climate zone, was also demonstrated. Port Mansfield in Texas was picked to represent the climate characteristics of a typical cotton-growing area.</p>

<p><em>Figure7. Model Results Under Varying Precipitation in Humid Subtropical Climate (Stoneville, MS)</em></p>
<p>Figure 7. shows the mechanistic model results for soil water and nutrient dynamics in a humid subtropical climate (Stoneville, Mississippi) under varying precipitation scenarios (maximum, mean, and minimum). The results are shown in two sets of plots. The x-axis represents time within one year, ranging from 0 to 1. Plots in the first row (a, b, c) display the changes in soil nutrients over time, specifically total biomass (red), nitrogen available to plants (green), and organic matter fraction in soil (blue). Plots in the second row (d, e, f) illustrate the in precipitation with randomized weather event (blue line), groundwater levels (red line), and soil water content (blue line) across three precipitation scenarios.</p>
<p>From the soil nutrient data, we can observe the seasonal dynamics of biomass levels as well as plant-available nitrogen in the soil. At the beginning of cultivation, with the application of fertilizer, nitrogen levels reach their peak and then decrease as the crop continues to grow. From the soil water data, we can see that a water surplus exists in both the max and mean rainfall scenarios, leading to a significant rise in groundwater levels (d, e).</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis on Reference Model Results, Humid Continental (warm summer)</strong></p>

<p><em>Figure 8. Model Results Under Varying Precipitation in Humid Continental (warm summer) (Arnold, IA)</em></p>
<p>Figure 8. shows the mechanistic model results for soil water and nutrient dynamics in a humid subtropical climate (Arnold, Iowa) under varying precipitation scenarios (maximum, mean, and minimum). In soil water, we can see three precipitation cases covers high water excess, minor water deficit and large water deficit, indication that the locational conditions can be a good setting for us to use this reference model to explain the situation. Also, notice that the precipitation pattern (blue) is different from Stoneville, and hence causing different dynamics in soil water content (green), for example, no significant seasonal variation.</p>
<h2 id="preliminary-predictive-modeling">Preliminary Predictive Modeling</h2>
<p>This section focuses on predictive modeling and dimensionality reduction for analyzing the relationship between rainfall and corn yield under varying environmental scenarios. The study leverages a mechanistic dataset with high dimensionality and computational complexity. The primary objectives include implementing a decision tree regression model for single-scenario prediction and utilizing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for multi-scenario dimensionality reduction. By combining these approaches, the project aims to reduce computational cost while preserving the predictive accuracy and interpretability of the model.</p>
<p><strong>1. Data Description of One Scenario</strong></p>
<p>The dataset includes 100 rows of data and several key columns, each playing an essential role in the analysis.
The <em>sim_index</em> column represents the simulation timeline, allowing the data to be tracked sequentially.
While not directly used in the model, it helps visualize time-dependent trends.
The <em>MULTIPLIER_FOR_RAINFALL</em> column is a scaling factor applied to raw rainfall data, reflecting environmental adjustments or experimental conditions.
Using this multiplier, the rain_amount column is calculated as the cumulative rainfall over time,
serving as the independent variable in the regression analysis to explore its impact on biomass production.
The <em>precipitation</em> column indicates the level of rainfall at each time point, providing additional environmental context.
Similarly, the <em>soil_moisture</em> column captures the moisture levels in the soil, influenced by rainfall and precipitation.
This column is not directly used in the predictive model now.
Finally, the <em>total_biomass</em> column represents the dependent variable, measuring the biomass produced under given conditions.
This serves as the target variable in the regression model, with predictions based on the <em>rain_amount</em> variable.
Together, these columns create a comprehensive dataset for analyzing the interplay between rainfall and biomass in varying environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The dataset’s variables are used in specific ways to build and analyze the predictive model.
The <em>rain_amount column</em>, derived by multiplying <em>MULTIPLIER_FOR_RAINFALL</em> and <em>raw rainfall</em> data,
serves as the core predictor to model its relationship with total_biomass.
This dependent variable acts as the target for the regression analysis, allowing the model to evaluate its predictive accuracy.
Supporting variables such as <em>precipitation</em> and <em>soil_moisture</em> provide additional environmental context,
which could be leveraged for feature engineering in more advanced models.
The <em>sim_index</em> ensures that the data can be tracked sequentially for exploratory analysis and visualization.
These relationships enable the construction of a decision tree regression model, which uses <em>rain_amount</em> to predict <em>total_biomass</em>,
and its performance is validated through visualizations and comparisons with the observed data.</p>
<p><strong>2. Multiple Scenario Analysis with SVD and PCA</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Data Description of All Scenario</strong></p>
<p>We aim to recreate a simplified surrogate model to reduce the computation time of the mechanistic model. In the mechanistic model, 17 different variables are calculated for every iteration. Each variable represents time-series data consisting of 100 data points over a 1-year range. Among these variables, ‘precipitation’ and ‘multiplier for precipitation’ serve as inputs, and their combination constitutes a new scenario. ‘Total biomass’ refers to the yield of corn, which is the final output. The remaining 14 variables are intermediate variables used in the calculations. In summary, for every scenario, the outputs include 17 time-series variables, each with 100 data points, accumulating to a total of 1,700 data points per scenario.</p>
<p>To generate a spectrum of scenarios for better estimation of corn yield across the U.S., we overlap the major corn production map with the climate zone map and select 9 sampling locations representing three major climate zones. For each location, precipitation data is gathered over a 20- to 21-year period. Additional scenarios are generated by using corrected precipitation, calculated as the product of meteorological ‘precipitation’ data and a ‘multiplier for precipitation’ ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 (representing suboptimal conditions). This approach results in a total of 1,692 scenarios, which is the product of the number of locations (9), years of precipitation data (20-21), and multipliers for precipitation (9). It is also confirmed that the simulation data remains consistent and can be accurately reconstructed after this data transformation process.</p>
<p>In summary, the dataset consists of 1692 scenarios and 1700 datapoints for each scenario. Using the mechanistic model to generate this dataset and stored as a csv file, consisting inputs, output and intermediate variables.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Dimension Reduction by SVD</strong></p>
<p>The original mechanistic model consists of 87 equations and above 100 variables for each iteration step, 15 of which are integral equations updated at each iteration. This high dimensionality and computational complexity increase computational time and make the model difficult to interpret. To address these challenges, we apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, evaluate the contribution of the most important principal components, and recreate the dataset using the compressed eigenvectors.</p>
<p>To prepare the dataset for SVD, we first reorganized the data by stretching all the data points in one scenario into a single column in the DataFrame. Each variable has 100 time-series elements and the number of columns equals the total number of scenarios. Second, we calculated the average scenario by horizontally taking the mean value across scenarios, then subtracted this average scenario from the dataset itself to obtain the centered data (X). Third, we performed SVD on the centered data to obtain the three singular components (U, S, and V’).</p>
<p>Figure 9 illustrates the singular values (𝐹.𝑆) plotted on a logarithmic scale, highlighting that the dataset’s variance starts relatively small and decreases sharply at the initial stage. It can be estimated from the model that the variance explained by the first three principal components (PCA modes) captures more than 99.5% of the variance, indicating that it is sufficient to reconstruct the dataset using the first three PCA modes. Additionally, Table 1 visualizes the first 10 eigen-scenarios (columns of 𝐹.𝑈), providing insights into the dataset’s principal structures. Finally, the dataset was reconstructed using the compressed data from the SVD process, and Table 2 displays the scenario reconstructed as the number of the PCA modes increase.</p>

<p><em>Table 3. Precipitation scenario visualization for classification</em></p>
<p>Based on the mechanism of the original simulation model, it can be concluded that precipitation is the dominant determinant of total biomass. Therefore, the focus of the analysis is placed on annual precipitation and average annual precipitation (as shown in Table 3). These figures indicate that the precipitation data from the two humid continental climate zones are not easily distinguishable. However, on the average annual precipitation plot, it can be observed that a reasonable separation method is to classify a climate as continental when the average annual total precipitation is less than or equal to 1.1, and as humid subtropical when it is greater than 1.1. Different predictive modeling methods are then applied to each case to predict total biomass. Finally, after the precipitation scenarios are separated into subgroups, another decision tree model is implemented to fit the curve.</p>
<p><strong>3.1 Curve fitting with Decision Tree</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this function is to construct a regression tree model based on the feature data (P) and target data (B). The recursion stops when the sample size is less than or equal to the minimum split sample size (min_samples_split) or when the maximum depth (depth) is reached. In this case, the mean of the target variable is used as the prediction value. The model attempts to iterate over all unique values of the feature to find the split point that minimizes the error (sum of squared losses) for the left and right subsets. The smaller the squared loss, the higher the homogeneity of the dataset. Once the best split point is found, the model splits the data into left and right subtrees and recursively constructs the subtrees until the stopping criteria are met.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Model Workflow</strong></p>
<p>The training phase involves using the decision_tree_regression function to recursively split the training dataset and construct the decision tree model. At each step of the split, the possible split points are iterated over, and the squared loss is calculated to select the optimal split point, which divides the dataset into two homogeneous subsets. In the prediction phase, the predict_tree function is used to predict new data. Each new feature value is directed through the tree’s split rules to locate the corresponding leaf node, and the mean value of that node is output as the final prediction.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Experimental Results and Analysis</strong></p>
<p>By testing the decision tree regression model on the rainfall data and the biomass data, it was observed that the model effectively performed segmented predictions based on the given data, which continuously split the feature space to minimize the variance of the target variable as much as possible. The goodness of fit is used to estimate the prediction outcome, which is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{SS} _{\text{tot}}}{\text{SS} _{\text{res}}}\)</span>,
in which <span class="math inline">\({\text{SS} _{\text{tot}}}\)</span> is Total Sum of Squares, <span class="math inline">\({\text{SS} _{\text{res}}}\)</span> is Residual Sum of Squares.</p>
<p>Although this implementation is relatively simplified, it effectively demonstrates the core ideas and basic construction process of decision tree regression.</p>

<p><em>Figure 11. Prediction result of model with depth 3</em></p>
<p>Figure 11 is the result of model with depth 3 which has a goodness of fit 96.91%. It can be observed that as the number of layers in the decision tree increases, its fitting performance in the early stages improves. In fact, the final goodness of fit is also higher.</p>
<p><strong>4 Predictive Modeling by Neural Network</strong></p>
<p>For this scenario, we also performed model predictions based on a neural network. This part of the code is primarily based on the method from HW7. First, the CSV file is read and converted into a DataFrame <em>df</em>. Next, using the <em>groupby</em> and <em>combine</em> functions, the columns <em>MULTIPLIER_FOR_RAINFALL</em>, <em>rain_amount</em>, <em>precipitation</em>, and <em>total_biomass</em> are extracted as the dataset, and the new DataFrame is named <em>df2</em>.</p>
<p>Considering that in the original data, the value of <em>total_biomass</em> becomes zero starting from row 63 due to crop harvesting, only rows 1 to 62 contain valid <em>total_biomass</em> values. So we have these rows extracted and named them another dataframe <em>df1</em>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, functions related to the neural network are defined. Functions such as <em>dense_layer</em>, <em>train!</em>, and <em>relu</em> are implemented, and a two-layer neural network is used for fitting. In this fitting process, the <em>relu</em> function is applied to the first layer and the <em>gelu</em> function is applied to the second.</p>
<p>Next, the neural network functions are executed. The hidden layer size is set to 6, the learning rate is set to 0.001, and the number of training iterations is set to 5000 for fitting. Afterward, the results are visualized, generating the following plots. By comparing the predicted values’ plot with the true values’ plot, it is concluded that while the trends are similar, the fitting quality is still poor. This conclusion is further supported by an RMSE value of 1000.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/028f9d3d-155c-4abb-8436-a17a8443596e" style="width:50.0%" />
</figure>
<p><em>Figure 12. Prediction result of model with depth 100</em></p>
<p>This is the result of the neural network model. This figure looks different from the figure 11 because in this time we only take the first 62 time points since the 63rd point is the harvest point where the total biomass turn to zero until the end of this time period. Initially we wanted to do the modeling of the whole section. However we found it quite hard to have a close prediction even in correct shape. And when it comes to the result of nerual network, we can see that the highest point on the figure is approximately 5500, which is far from Figure 11. From this result we can see that the prediction is not good. The reason might be the HW 7 basically solve the regression problem but this time out data points are non-linear. The choice modeling function inside the layers are <em>relu</em> and <em>gelu</em>, as they might not be the ideal function for modeling. Overall we could see an result but the quality of this result is quite bad. Perhaps using CNN model would be better in this scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This project successfully demonstrates the application of decision tree regression for predictive modeling in one scenario and SVD for dimensionality reduction. In the single scenario analysis, the decision tree regression effectively predicts biomass based on rainfall data, with high goodness-of-fit scores for both shallow and deep trees. In the multi-scenario analysis, the SVD process reduces the dataset’s dimensionality while retaining critical information, enabling more efficient modeling and interpretation.
These methods provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing complex datasets in agricultural and environmental studies. Future work could explore integrating additional features, such as soil properties, or applying more advanced machine learning models to further improve predictive performance.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Based on the previous findings, the project demonstrated predictive modeling of biomass production using decision tree regression and SVD for dimensionality reduction.
While the decision tree model showed higher accuracy (up to 97.14%), its performance may face challenges with larger datasets.
Additionally, the neural network model faced limitations, with poorer fit and higher RMSE.
Future work should focus on refining model structures to improve accuracy and consistency across different datasets by steps such as expanding datasets, applying different machine learning methods, and solving existing neural network challenges.</p>
